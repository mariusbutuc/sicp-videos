# SICP » Video Lectures

We started [reading SICP again][SICPv2]. Yesterday we met for the first session. And no, I had not watched the first lecture.
[Got the book][tweet] right after, and now eager to start the download. Too many clicks.

> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

Hence, this!

> [These twenty video lectures][on-mit] by **Hal Abelson** and **Gerald Jay Sussman** are a complete presentation of the course, given in **July 1986** for Hewlett-Packard employees, and professionally produced by Hewlett-Packard Television. These videos are also available [here][original-home] under a Creative Commons license compatible with commercial use.

> Note: These lectures follow the first edition (1985) of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. Many of the programs discussed were rewritten for the second edition (1996) of the book, and new material was added. These video lectures will still be useful for students using the second edition, since the overall themes of the course and order of presentation are unchanged.

Put SICP to good use, and remember to _use your confusion, it's your strongest asset_.
